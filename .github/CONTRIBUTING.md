# Contributing

Hello there! It seems that you are interested in contributing to one of my personal
project offerings. That is fantastic news! Thank you for taking the time out of your 
day to help one of my projects.

I have a few simple but important rules for accepting contributions:

- Don't be a jerk
- Adhere to the existing code style

If you would like to introduce a breaking change to the API, or a refactor of the
code-base, please first submit an issue to discuss these changes. I welcome all
contributions, including these more intrusive ones! I just ask that we have a transparent
discussion about them first.

Lastly, in the end this is my code-base. As such, I have the final say in any new changes.

That's it! Thanks for reading. I look forward to collaborating with you.
